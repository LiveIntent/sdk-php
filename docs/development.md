### Unit Tests

The SDK uses Heimdall/Bifrost to authenticate so you need to create a Client and use that Client's Secret and Identifier. 

#### Create a Client in Bifrost

First you need to get a token from Bifrost using the `oauth/token` endpoint.

Grab the token and put it into the Authorize-header in the Heimdall API.

You can use the Heimdall API to create your client.

```php
{
  "name": "testClient234",
  "environment": "server",
  "redirectUri": "https://qa-heimdall.liveintenteng.com/sign-in"
}
```

Take the response and copy the secret and identifier and put that into your `.env`

```php
{
  "secret": "<some secret>",
  "id": <some id>,
  "name": "<some name>",
  "identifier": "<some identifier>",
  "redirectUri": "https://qa-heimdall.liveintenteng.com/sign-in",
  "created": "<some datetime>",
  "updated": "<some datetime>"
}
```

#### Client Secret and Identifier

In the `.env` file

```php
CLIENT_ID=<identifier from response>
CLIENT_SECRET=<secret from response>

LI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 // Pointing to Heimdall
```


### Linting
